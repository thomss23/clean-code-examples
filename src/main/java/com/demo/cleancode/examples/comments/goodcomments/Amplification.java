/**
The comment is useful because it provides information that is not readily apparent from the code itself. This information
can be valuable to other developers who are working with the code and need to understand the performance characteristics of the generateReport method.

Amplification comments can be used to provide additional context, explain design decisions, or provide any other information
that is relevant to understanding the code.
By providing this additional information, amplification comments can help make the code easier to understand and maintain.
