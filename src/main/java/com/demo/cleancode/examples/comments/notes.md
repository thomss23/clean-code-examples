**Notes on Comments**

**Intro**
* The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in
code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are always failures. We must
have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them,
but their use is not a cause for celebration.
* Why am I so down on comments? Because they lie. Not always, and not intentionally,
  but too often. The older a comment is, and the farther away it is from the code it describes,
  the more likely it is to be just plain wrong. The reason is simple. Programmers canâ€™t realistically maintain them.
* It is possible to make the point that programmers should be disciplined enough to
  keep the comments in a high state of repair, relevance, and accuracy. I agree, they should.
  But I would rather that energy go toward making the code so clear and expressive that it
  does not need the comments in the first place. 
* Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments at all. They delude and mislead.
  They set expectations that will never be fulfilled. They lay down old rules that need not, or
  should not, be followed any longer.
* Truth can only be found in one place: the code. Only the code can truly tell you what
  it does. It is the only source of truly accurate information. Therefore, though comments are
  sometimes necessary, we will expend significant energy to minimize them.
