TODOs are jobs that the programmer thinks should be done, but for some reason
canâ€™t do at the moment. It might be a reminder to delete a deprecated feature or a
plea for someone else to look at a problem. It might be a request for someone else to
think of a better name or a reminder to make a change that is dependent on a
planned event. Whatever else a TODO might be, it is not an excuse to leave bad code in
the system.
